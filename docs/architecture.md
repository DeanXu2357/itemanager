# Personal Asset Management - Architecture

## Overview

The Personal Asset Management app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which is recommended by Google for Android app development. This architecture promotes separation of concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

## Key Components

### Model

The Model layer represents the data and business logic of the application. It includes:

- **Data Entities**: `Item` and `ItemType`
- **Data Access Objects (DAOs)**: `ItemDao` and `ItemTypeDao`
- **Room Database**: `AssetDatabase`

### View

The View layer is responsible for displaying the user interface and capturing user interactions. It includes:

- **Activities**: `MainActivity`, `AddItemActivity`
- **Fragments**: `HomeFragment`, `CategoriesFragment`, `StatisticsFragment`, `SettingsFragment`
- **XML Layouts**: Corresponding layout files for activities and fragments

### ViewModel

The ViewModel acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, providing data to the View and processing user actions. It includes:

- **MainViewModel**: Manages data for the main screen and item list

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the View (e.g., adding a new item)
2. View communicates the action to the ViewModel
3. ViewModel processes the action and interacts with the Model (e.g., inserting a new item into the database)
4. Model updates the data and notifies the ViewModel
5. ViewModel updates the live data
6. View observes the live data changes and updates the UI accordingly

## Current Implementation Status

### Data Layer

- `Item` and `ItemType` entities are implemented
- `ItemDao` and `ItemTypeDao` interfaces are defined
- `AssetDatabase` is set up using Room

### UI Layer

- `MainActivity` is implemented with bottom navigation
- `HomeFragment` is partially implemented to display the item list
- Placeholder implementations for `CategoriesFragment`, `StatisticsFragment`, and `SettingsFragment`
- `AddItemActivity` is partially implemented for adding new items

### ViewModel

- `MainViewModel` is implemented to manage the item list

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Categories feature, including UI and data management
2. Develop the Statistics feature to provide basic asset statistics
3. Implement the Settings feature for app configuration
4. Enhance the AddItemActivity to support barcode scanning
5. Implement data validation and error handling
6. Add unit tests and instrumentation tests

## Considerations for Future Development

- Implement data synchronization with a backend server
- Add user authentication and multi-user support
- Implement more advanced asset tracking features (e.g., value depreciation, maintenance schedules)
- Enhance the UI with more detailed asset views and editing capabilities

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the Personal Asset Management app and allows for easy expansion and maintenance as the project grows.

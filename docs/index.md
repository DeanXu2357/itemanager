## Project Overview

Personal Asset Management is an Android application designed to help users manage their personal assets efficiently. The app allows users to add, categorize, and track various types of assets, as well as view basic statistics about their asset portfolio.

## Architecture

The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which is recommended by Google for Android app development. This pattern helps in separating the user interface logic from the business logic and data management.

The main components of the architecture are:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. This includes the Room database, data access objects (DAOs), and data entities.
- **View**: Responsible for displaying the user interface and capturing user interactions. This includes activities, fragments, and layout files.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, providing data to the View and processing user actions.

For a detailed explanation of the project's architecture, including component interactions and data flow, please refer to the [Architecture Documentation](architecture.md).

## Data Model

The core data entities in the application are:

1. **Item**: Represents a single asset item.
2. **ItemType**: Represents a category or type of asset.

These entities are managed using Room, Android's recommended ORM for local data storage.

## UI Components

The application uses a single activity with multiple fragments approach, utilizing the Navigation component for managing navigation between different screens.

Main UI components include:

1. **MainActivity**: The main container activity that hosts all fragments.
2. **HomeFragment**: Displays the list of asset items.
3. **CategoriesFragment**: Manages asset categories.
4. **StatisticsFragment**: Shows basic statistics about the user's assets.
5. **SettingsFragment**: Allows users to configure app settings.

## Current Implementation Status

- Basic project structure set up
- Data models and DAOs implemented
- Main activity with bottom navigation
- Home fragment for displaying asset list
- Placeholder fragments for Categories, Statistics, and Settings

For more details on the current implementation and next steps, please refer to the [Architecture Documentation](architecture.md#current-implementation-status).

## Future Enhancements

- Implement barcode scanning for quick item addition
- Add data visualization for asset statistics
- Implement user authentication and cloud sync
- Add support for recurring assets or liabilities

For a more comprehensive list of planned enhancements and considerations for future development, see the [Architecture Documentation](architecture.md#considerations-for-future-development).

This documentation will be updated as the project progresses and more features are implemented.
